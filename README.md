### Project Info:
Zombieland - Survival Game stands as the combination of the words “game” and “finance”. In doing so, GameFi brings together Bittorrent blockchain technology, including NFTs, cryptocurrencies and decentralization, and advanced gaming mechanics where players can generate income from simply playing and enjoying their gaming experience.

Zombieland - Survival Game powers where players are financially rewarded for the time and effort they put into playing. This model is better known as Play-And-Earn. Economic incentives might include tokens, upgrades and much more. Typically, players are rewarded for completing game-related tasks like progressing through different levels.
